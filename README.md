RunAway is a virtual reality mobile application that enables the average individual running or exercising in distracting or boring environments like a gym or their living room the opportunity to travel to different worlds during their workout

__Vision:__ We want to create a new running experience and making boring treadmill runs more fun, enjoyable and attract more people that would not have exercised before to get more active.
